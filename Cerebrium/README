# Cerebrium

## Steps

1. Get a Cerebrium Account, you can get 30 free credits to run things on their platform.

2. Install the Cerebrium CLI
```
pip install cerebrium --upgrade
```

3. Create a new App
```
cerebrium init my-first-project
```

4. Change to project directory
```
cd my-first-project
```
then add all the files from ``` /Cerebrium_API ``` folder into the project directory.

5. Deploy your App
```
cerebrium deploy
``
then follow the steps to sign in and deploy to your account.

6. Test
Use the bench.py script to test each gpu using the same exact input and code. To switch GPU, you will have to change the GPU in the project config file and then re-deploy. For my data I only tested the ones that are free (for free plan useres) to use, T4,L4, L40, A10.
